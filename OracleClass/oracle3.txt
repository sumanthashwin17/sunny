where clause 
============
It is used to select specific records from database table.

syntax:
-------
	select * from <table_name> where condition;

ex:
	select * from student where sno=101;

	select * from student where sname='ramana';

	select * from student where sadd='pune';

Interview Queries

===============
It is used to update the records which are present in database.

syntax:
-------
	update <table_name> set <col_name>=value where condition;

ex:
	update student set sname='rani' where sno=101; 

	update student set sadd='chennai' where sname='ravi';

	update student set sname='Alan',sadd='USA' where sno=106;

Note:
-----
	If we won't use where clause then all rows will be updated.

	update student set sname='raja';
	update student set sadd='hyd';
	commit;


Delete command 
=============

syntax:
-------
	delete from <table_name> where condition;

ex:
	delete from student where sno=101;

	delete from student where sname='ramana';

	delete from student where sadd='pune';

Note:
-----
	If we won't use where clause then all rows will be deleted.
	ex:
		delete from student;
		delete from emp;
		delete from dept;
		commit;

Interview Queries

Logical Operators 
==================
Using logical operators we can declare multiple conditions in where clause.

We have three logical operators.

1) AND 

2) OR 

3) NOT 


1) AND 
----------
It returns the records if all conditions are true.

Here conditions must be from same row only.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Alan';

	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Nelson';
	
	select * from emp where eid=301 AND ename='Jojo';

2) OR 
------
It returns the records only if one condition is true.

Here condition can be from any row.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Alan';

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Nelson';

	select * from emp where eid=301 OR ename='Nelson';

	select * from emp where eid=301 OR ename='Jojo';


3) NOT 
--------
It returns the records except the condition.

A <> symbol denoted as NOT operator.

ex:
	select * from student where NOT sno=101;
	select * from student where  sno<>101;


	select * from student where NOT sname='ramulu';
	select * from student where  sname<>'ramulu';


Interview Queries 
------------------

Q) Write a query to display employees information whose salary is greater then 15000 and less then 35000?

	select * from emp where esal>15000 AND esal<35000;



Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee id is 201,202 and 203?

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR eid=202 OR eid=203;



Q) Write a query to display employees information whose who are not working in 10 department?

	select * from emp where NOT deptno=10;
	select * from emp where  deptno<>10;



Between Operator 
================
It is used to return the records those who are in range of values.

In between operator , first we need to declare lower limit then higher limit.

ex:
	select * from emp where esal between 15000 AND 30000;

	select * from emp where eid between 201 and 206;

	select * from emp where deptno between 10 and 30;


IN operator 
===========
In operator is a replacement of OR operator.

It is used to return the records those who are matching in the list of values.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,203);

	select * from emp where ename IN('Alan','Erick','Anderson');

	select * from emp where deptno IN (10,20,30);


Pattern Matching operators 
===========================
Pattern matching operators are used to select the letters.

We have two types of pattern matching operators.

1) Percentage (%)

2) Underscore (_) 


1) Percentage (%)
-----------------

Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee name starts with 'A' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like 'A%';


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee name ends with 'n' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '%n';


Q) Write  query to display employees information whose employee name having middle letter as 'l'?

	select * from emp where ename like '%l%';
