Types of data 
=============
We have two types of data.

1) Unstructured Data 

2) Structured Data 

1) Unstructured Data 
---------------------
Data which is not in readable format is called unstructured data.

In general, meaningless data is called unstructured data.

ex:
	201    Lakemba     SYD      NSW      AUS


2) Structured Data 
-------------------
Data which is in readable format is called structured data.

In general, meaningfull data is called structured data.

ex:
	Unit	Locality   City     State    Country
	-----   ---------  -----    -----    --------
	201    Lakemba     SYD      NSW      AUS



Oracle 
=======
It is one of the database that is used to store structured data.

It is also consider as relational database.

It is a prodoct of Oracle Corporation.

It is classified into two types.

1) SQL  (Structured Query Language)

2) PL/SQL (Procedural Language Extensions to Structured Query Language)



Q) What is the difference between DBMS	and RDBMS ?

DBMS						RDBMS
-----------					----------
It is a Database Management System.		It is a Relational Database Management System.		
It stores the data in a file.			It stores the data in a table.

It provides facility to connect single user.	It provides facility to connect multiple users.

It is not designed for large data storage.	It is designed for large data storage.

It does not support normalization.		It supports normalization.

There is no data security.			There is a high data security.


Client/Server Architecture 
===========================
In this architecture we will see how our data will proceed from frontend to backend.

Diagram: oracle1.1

FrontEnd
-------
The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.
ex:
	C++, Java, .Net, Python, Perl and etc.

Communication Channel 
-----------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC - Java Database Connectivity 
	ODBC - Open Database Connectivity 
	PDBC - Python Database Connectivity 

BackEnd
--------
The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.
ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, Teradata, MariaDB , MongoDB, NoSQL and etc.

Management System 
==================
Management system is a software which is used to manage the database.

Using management system we can perform following activities easily.

1) Inserting new data 

2) Updating existing data 

3) Deleting unnecessary data

4) Selecting required data


RDBMS
=========
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

It is used to manage and store the data in a relational database.

If a database is created based relational theory to manage the database is called relational database management system.

We have following list of relational databases.

ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, Teradata and etc.


SQL
=====
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to interact with oracle database.

It is a case insensitive language.

It is a command based language.

Every command must starts with verbs i.e create, insert, update, delete and etc.

Every command must ends with semicolon (;).

It is developed by Mr.Codd in 1972 (By IBM). 


Table 
=======
A table is an object which is used to represent the data.

A table is a collection of rows and columns.

Data which is present in a table is a case sensitive.

ex:
	No	|	Name	|	Address
	-----------------------------------------
	101	|	Alan	|	Texas
	-----------------------------------------
	102	|	Jack	|	Chicago
	-----------------------------------------
	103	|	John	|	Florida
	-----------------------------------------	

	Here we have 3 rows and 3 columns.
