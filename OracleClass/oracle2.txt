SQL
=====
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to communicate with oracle database.

It is a case insensitive language.

It is a command based language.

Every command must starts with verb like create,update,delete,truncate and etc.

Every command must ends with semicolon (;).

It is a language is developed in 1972 by Mr.Codd (By IBM).

Sub languages of SQL
=====================
We have five sub languages of SQL.

1) DDL (Data Definition Language)

2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)

3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)

4) TCL (Transaction Control Language)

5) DCL (Data Control Language)


1) DDL (Data Definition Language)
---------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the objects in database.

It is a collection of five commands.

ex:
	create, alter, drop, truncate and rename 


2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)
------------------------------------
This language is used to manipulate the which is present in database.

It is a collection of four commands.

ex:
	insert, update, delete and merge 


3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)
-------------------------------
This language is used to retrieve the data from database.

It is a collection of one command.

ex:
	select 

4) TCL (Transaction Control Language)
-------------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the transaction in a database.

It is a collection of three commands.

ex:
	commit, rollback and savepoint 


5) DCL (Data Control Language)
-----------------------------
This language is used to control the access of data.

It is a collection of two commands.

ex:
	grant and revoke

Establish the Connection with Oracle Database 
==============================================
To execute any query in database we need to establish the connection with database.
Once the work with database is executed then we need to close the connection with database.

1) 
	SQL> connect
	Enter username : system 
	Enter password : admin 
	
	SQL> disconnect 


2) 
	SQL> conn 
	Enter username : system 
	Enter password : admin 
	
	SQL> disc 


3)
	SQL> conn system/admin 
	SQL> disc 


create command 
===============
It is used to create a table in a database.

syntax:
-------
	create table <table_name>(col1 datatype(size),col2 datatype(size),.......,
							colN datatype(size));

ex:
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	create table dept(deptno number(3),dname varchar2(10),dloc varchar2(10));

	create table emp(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10,2),
				deptno number(3),job varchar2(10),comm number(6));	



Describe command 
================
A describe command is used to see the structure of a table.

syntax:
------
	desc <table_name>;
ex:
	desc student;
	desc dept;
	desc emp;

Insert command 
==============
It is used to insert a record/row in a database table.

syntax:
-------
	insert into <table_name> values(val1,val2,...,valN);

ex:

Approach1
---------
	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi'); //invalid 

	insert into student values('ravi',102,'delhi'); //invalid 

	insert into student values(102,'ravi',null);

Approach2
----------
	insert into student(sno,sname,sadd) values(103,'ramana','vizag');

	insert into student(sno,sname) values(104,'ramulu');

Approach3
---------
	Using '&' symbol we can read dynamic inputs.
	
	insert into student values(&sno,'&sname','&sadd');


commit command 
==============
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.

syntax:
--------
	commit;


dept table 
===========
create table dept(deptno number(3),dname varchar2(10),dloc varchar2(10));

insert into dept values(10,'CSE','HYD');
insert into dept values(20,'ECE','DELHI');
insert into dept values(30,'EEE','VIZAG');
insert into dept values(40,'MEC','PUNE');
commit;


emp table 
=========
create table emp(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10,2),
				deptno number(3),job varchar2(10),comm number(6));

insert into emp values(201,'Alan',9000,10,'Clerk',null);
insert into emp values(202,'Linda',19000,10,'Clerk',500);

insert into emp values(203,'Kelvin',22000,20,'HR',500);
insert into emp values(204,'Nelson',42000,30,'HR',900);

insert into emp values(205,'Brook',27000,30,'Manager',500);
insert into emp values(206,'Nancy',39000,30,'Manager',800);

commit;

select command 
===============
It is used to select the rows/records from database table.

syntax:
------
	select * from <table_name>;

	Here '*' means all rows and columns.

ex:
	select * from emp;
	select * from dept;
	select * from student;

Projection:
-----------
Selecting specific columns from database table is called projection.

ex:
	select sno,sname,sadd from student;
	select sno,sname from student;
	select sadd from student;

Arithmetic operations:
----------------------
In select command we can perform arithmetic operations also.

ex:
	select sno-100,sname,sadd from student;
	select sno+100,sname,sadd from student;

Column Alias: 
-------------
A userdefined heading given to a column is called column alias.	
ex:
	select sno-100 as SNO,sname,sadd from student;
	
	select sno as rollno ,sname as name,sadd as city from student;
