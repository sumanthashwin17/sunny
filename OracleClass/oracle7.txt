TCL commands
=============
We have three TCL commands.

1) commit 

2) rollback 

3) savepoint 

1) commit
-----------
It is used to commit the changes permanent to database.

ex:
	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	commit;

2) rollback 
------------
It is used to undo the changes which are not permanent.
ex:
	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	commit;

	insert into student values(103,'Alan','USA');

	insert into student values(104,'Jose','UAE');

	select * from student; //  4 records 

	rollback;

	select * from student; // 2 records 


3) savepoint 
-------------
A SAVEPOINT is a logical rollback point in a transaction.

Instead of complete rollback we can rollback upto savepoint.

syntax:
------
	savepoint <savepoint_name>;

ex:
---
	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	savepoint sp1;

	insert into student values(103,'Alan','USA');

	insert into student values(104,'Jose','UAE');

	savepoint sp2;

	insert into student values(105,'Jacky','China');

	insert into student values(106,'Lara','Japan');

	select * from student; // 6 records 

	rollback to sp2; 

	select * from student; // 4 records 

DCL command 
=============
It is a collection of two commands.

1) grant 

2) revoke 

schema 
------
	A schema is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.

Privileges
----------
	Permissions given to a user is called privileges.
	
	In general, rights given to a user is called privileges.
	
	We have two types of privileges.
	
	1) Object privilege : Permission given by DBA to user. 
		
	2) System privilege : Permission give by one user to another user.

1) grant 
----------
A grant command is used to grant the permission to the user.

syntax:
-----
	grant <privilege1>,<privilege2> to <user_name>;

2) revoke 
----------
A revoke command is used to revoke the permissions from the user.

syntax:
--------
	revoke <privilege1>,<privilege2> from <user_name>;	


DBA> alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true; 

DBA> create user balu identified by balu;

DBA> create user monika identified by monika;

DBA> ALTER USER balu QUOTA UNLIMITED ON USERS;

balu> username : balu 
      password : balu 
      ---  logon denied	

monika> 
      username : monika
      password : monika
      ---  logon denied

DBA> grant connect,resource to balu,monika;	
 
balu> username : balu 
      password : balu 
      --- connected 
     

monika> 
      username : monika
      password : monika 
      --- connected 
    
balu> 
	create table employee(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(8));

	insert into employee values(501,'Alan',50000);

	insert into employee values(502,'Jose',80000);

	insert into employee values(503,'Kelvin',23000);

	commit;

	select * from employee;

monika> 
	select * from employee; // table or view does not exist


balu> 
	grant select on employee to monika;


monika>
	select * from balu.employee;

	delete from balu.employee; //insufficient privileges

balu> 
	grant delete,update on employee to monika;

monika>
	delete from balu.employee;
	commit;

balu>
	select * from employee;
	
	revoke select,update,delete on employee from monika;


monika> disc 
balu> disc 

DBA> revoke connect,resource from balu,monika;

balu> username : balu 
      password : balu 
      --- connected 
     

monika> 
      username : monika
      password : monika 
      --- connected 
    

Sequence 
=========
A sequence is an object which is used to generate the numbers.	

syntax:
------
	create sequence <sequence_name> start with value increment by value;

ex:
	create sequence sq1 start with 1 increment by 1;

	create sequence sq1 start with 101 increment by 1;

	create sequence sq1 start with 10 increment by 10;

We have two pseudo's in sequence.

1) NEXTVAL 
---------
It is used to generate next number in a sequence.
ex:
	create sequence sq1 start with 101 increment by 1;
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
	insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'ravi','delhi');
	insert into student values(sq1.NEXTVAL,'ramana','vizag');
	commit;

2) CURRVAL 
-------
It returns last number which is generated by the sequence.

ex:
	select sq1.CURRVAL from dual;


Q) Write a query to see the list of sequences present in database?

	select sequence_name from user_sequences;


Q) Write a query to drop the sequence?

	drop sequence sq1;


Synonym 
==========
Alter name given to a table is called synonym.

We can use synonym name instead of table name for all commands.

Using synonym name length of the table will reduce.

syntax:
-----
	create synonym <synonym_name> for <object_name>;
ex:
	create synonym e for employee; 
	
	select * from e;

	delete from e;

	drop table e; // table or view does not exist 

	drop table employee; // dropped 



Q) Write a query to see the list of synonyms present in database?

	select synonym_name from user_synonyms;


Q) Write a query to drop the synonym?
	
	drop synonym e;
